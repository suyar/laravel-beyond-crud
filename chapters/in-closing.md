# 写在最后（In closing）

“When will the book be complete?” � I kept asking myself this question these past few months. As I wrote, more topics popped into my head, and so the book grew. However, at some point I'd have to consider it finished, otherwise you would have never been able to read it.

I think we've arrived at that point.

I think I've written about all the things I wanted to write about, though if you'd ask me about any of these topics in person, we could probably still fill hours of conversation.

I kept the main goal of this book in mind though: it's not about learning patterns or concrete solutions, it's more about learning a mindset. And by doing so I have given you lots of patterns and solutions, but my hope is that, above all, you've learned to critically look at the architecture of your projects, and can start thinking about ways to improve them over time.

I hope that I was able to share my colleagues' and my own thought process with you: I wanted to include you in all the conversations and discussions we had over the past few years and explain why we came to the solutions we use today. And I hope that you can go through the same process with your colleagues, to find the best solutions for your problems.

In a way, I've been working on this book for years now: first at my previous job where I discovered my passion for code architecture and began to blog about it; at Spatie where I was able to apply all that knowledge, and learn from my colleagues while doing so; then came the blog posts before finally writing this book.

And so it has come to an end, at least for now, because honestly there's lots of stuff I still want to write about. For example, I've been venturing into event sourced applications and micro services the past few months; I also feel that there's lots to write about modern PHP as well. Ideas for the future? Who knows?

So in closing, I'd like to thank you for reading this book, and I truly hope I was able to share my thought process with you, and that it might help you in your future projects. I'd also like to thank Spatie for giving me the opportunity to work on this book, as well as my wife who has supported me during this whole process.

Finally there's one more chapter after this one: a collection of resources that inspired and guided me throughout the years, and influenced the vision I shared in this book tremendously. I hope the knowledge of all those great programmers will also help you, the same way it did for me.

Thanks.
